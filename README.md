# Building a ETL pipeline using airflow, S3, glue, redshift and quicksight

* Scraped data from [allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/) using python
* Deployed the code on Airflow on AWS EC2 instance to monitor workflows
* Saved scraped data in AWS S3 and cleaned it.
* Used AWS Glue job to migrate data from S3 to redshift
